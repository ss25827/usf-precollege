<h2>Faculty Bios</h2>

<h3>Amy Rust (lead faculty)</h3>
<p>An assistant professor in the Humanities & Cultural Studies Department at USF, Dr. Rust earned her Ph. D. in Film Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010. Her research explores the ways in which visual technologies mediate American cultural experience. She is currently completing a book about the emergence of graphic, corporeal violence in American cinema during the late 1960s and early 1970s. An expert in film genre and visual theory, Dr. Rust regularly teaches courses in international and American film history, documentary and experimental cinema, and the American horror film.</p>
 
<h3>Scott Ferguson (production lab faculty)</h4>
<p>An assistant professor in the Humanities & Cultural Studies Department at USF, Dr. Ferguson earned his Ph. D. in Film Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2009. Working at the intersection of visual studies and science studies, his research turns American and European film and new media histories toward explorations of child development and ecology. At USF, Dr. Ferguson has taught courses on the essay film, ecological media, and contemporary American filmmakers in addition to introductory courses in film and new media. Before entering academia, Dr. Ferguson was a professional Hollywood actor for 14 years. A member of the Screen Actors Guild, he has appeared in feature films, television programs, and commercials.

Rust has penned scripts for television (Moral Orel, The Very Funny Show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) as well as for feature films, including an as-yet-untitled Pee Wee Herman project. Rust can also be seen 
performing in two musical groups -- The Glass Beef (a rock-n-roll duo with Charlene Yi) and Don't Stop

and Adam McKay's comedy website, Funny or Die.</p>

<h2>Daily activites</h2>

<p>Dr. Rust will lead the morning workshops in film analysis, during which students will learn basic film history, the differences between narrative, experimental, and documentary cinema, 
as well as stylistic techniques and how these make meaning for spectators. She will also supervise, along with a teaching assistant, afternoon film screenings and discussion groups that 
exemplify these concepts and give students an opportunity to discuss them. Students will use what they learn in these film analysis workshops to produce their own films in the afternoon 
experiential learning sessions described below. Finally, she will lead workshops with students to discuss the various writing assignments they will complete, including a film review, a film 
sequence analysis, and an academic film essay.</p>

<p>Dr. Ferguson will lead afternoon sessions in experiential learning, during which students will get hands-on experience with the styles and techniques we study and discuss in the mornings and during screening sessions and discussion groups. He will introduce students to scenario writing, shooting, and editing, using digital cameras and editing software procured for these purposes. In the course of these experiential sessions, the students will produce one experimental or documentary short and one narrative short in groups of five. On off-campus field trip will provide students with location shooting experience. Other field trips include trips to local digital production houses.</p>

<p>Finally, Paul Rust, a professional screenwriter and actor in Los Angeles, will join on the afternoon of July 20 for a screenwriting workshop, during which he will introduce students to the art of fiction film writing and supervise their generation of scripts for the narrative short they will begin shooting the next day.</p>
