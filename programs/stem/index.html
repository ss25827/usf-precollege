<h2 style="margin-top:-40px;">STEM Pre-College Program</h2>
<p><strong>June 11 - July 20
<br />Commuter</strong></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Summer 2012 STEM Pre-College Program challenges high school students entering Grades 9 through 12, as well as graduating seniors, to explore the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics well beyond the high school level. Gifted students will be given the opportunity to explore these fields from multiple perspectives:</p>


<ul class="bull">
<li>Participating students will gain the perspective of a college student through their experiences in university courses.
	<ul class="disc">
	<li>These courses help in preparing students for university studies and easing the future transition to college life. Through the program, many students are able to earn high school 
	and college credits early in their academic careers, setting them ahead in their field of study.</li></ul>

</li>

<li>All instructors are experienced research professors from the University of South Florida. 
	<ul class="disc">
	<li>Studying under accomplished university professors gives students an early experience with the format of college level courses. 
This helps participants to discover, at an early stage, the individual strategies for learning in a University environment.</li></ul></li>

<li>Students will have the opportunity to experience the STEM fields from the perspective of researchers, dealing with real-world problems.
	<ul class="disc">
	<li>Research work is a required component of college students' resumes in the STEM fields, especially for those students intending to continue to graduate school. 
Participating students will get a jump start on the challenges of the STEM fields and experience the voyage of discovery that is continually evolving in these fields. 
</li></ul></li>

<li>Program participants will also experience the STEM fields through a hands-on approach. 
	<ul class="disc">
	<li>These experiences allow students to connect with both the STEM fields and with one another. Students leaving the program in previous years
 have created lasting friendships.  Many graduates of the program have discovered interests and pursued careers in STEM fields as well as created lasting friendships.
 </li></ul></li>

</ul>


<p> The STEM Education Center will host intelligent, motivated, and gifted students on the Tampa campus of the University of South Florida. The six-week program is designed to excite, challenge, and foster creative thinking, discovery and learning. The Program consists of two levels:</p>

<ul class="bull">
<li>Level I is designed for students entering grades 9 and 10.</li>
<li>Level II is for students entering grades 11, 12, and graduating seniors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The programs for level I and  level II begins on June 11, 2012 and continues through July 20, 2012. 
Classes meet Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>

<p>For more information on the Level I and II programs, please see the tabs above.</p>

<p>The deadline to submit an application is May 7, 2012.</p>
